#spotSepPix : float
#    Expected separation of the satellite spots from the star. Used as the
#    separation for the center of the region of interest. Units of pixels.
#    Compute beforehand as sep in lambda/D and multiply by pix per lambda/D.
#    13*(51.46*0.825/13)
spotSepPix: 42.4545

#roiRadiusPix : float
#    Radius of each region of interest used when summing the intensity of a
#    satellite spot. Units of pixels.
roiRadiusPix: 4.5

#probeRotVecDeg : array_like
#    1-D array of how many degrees counterclockwise from the x-axis to rotate
#    the regions of interest used when summing the satellite spots. Note that
#    a pair of satellite spots is given by just one value. For example, for a
#    single pair of satellite spots along the x-axis use [0, ] and not 
#    [0, 180]. And for a plus-shaped layout of spots, use [0, 90].
probeRotVecDeg: [0, 90]

#nSubpixels : int
#    Number of subpixels across used to make edge values of the region-of-
#    interest mask. The value of the edge pixels in the ROI is the mean of
#    all the subpixel values.
nSubpixels: 100

#nSteps : int
#    Number of points used along each direction for the grid search.
#    Odd numbers are better to provide symmetry of values when the array is
#    truly centered.
nSteps: 7

#stepSize : float
#    The step size used in the grid search. Units of pixels.
stepSize: 1.0

#nIter : int
#    Number of iterations in the loop that hones in on the stellar center
#    location.
nIter: 6
