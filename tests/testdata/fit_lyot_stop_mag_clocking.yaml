# Parameters for performing the fit of magnification and clocking at the
# lyot plane as seen at the science detector.
# Used by coralign.pupil.maskfit.fit_lyot_stop_mag_clocking().

# Parameters for fitting magnification and clocking at LSAM
clockMaxDeg: 2.0  # float, max +/- clocking error checked [degrees]
nClock: 11 # int, number of clocking values checked 

deltaAmpMax : 0.5 # float, Maximum allowed amplitude difference allowed
# between a measured mask and a reference mask for that pixel to be
# counted as matching in value.

# Pixel counts
diamPupil: 300.0  # float, nominal/expected number of pixels across the
                  # major beam diameter

# Parameters for performing the tune-up magnification fit

#magShrinkFac : float
#    Factor by which to shrink deltaMag each loop iteration.
#    Must be > 0 and < 1.
magShrinkFac: 0.5

#deltaMag : float

nMag: 11

#nIterMag : int
#    Number of iterations over which to refine the magnification estimate.
