# Parameters for performing the scale fit
# during DM registration with DMREG.

# maxDeltaScaleFac : float
#     Max +/- delta scale factor to evaluate. Must be larger than the largest
#     possible delta scale value or else the quadratic fitting function will
#     perform poorly. For clarification, a delta scale factor of 0.10 is a
#     10% increase in scale. Unitless.
maxDeltaScaleFac : 0.10

# nScale : int
#     Number of scale factors to evaluate between (1-maxDeltaScaleFac) and
#     and (1+maxDeltaScaleFac), inclusive, for both the x- and y-axes.
nScale : 7

# nIter : int
#     Number of times to iterate the scale fit. Each new iteration is
#     centered about the previous best estimate.
nIter : 3

# shrinkFac : float
#     Factor by which to change maxDeltaScaleFac after each iteration
#     of the fit. Must be >0.0 and <= 1.0.
shrinkFac : 0.8
