# Number of iterations to perform for binary_dilation() and binary_erosion()

# of the nominal pupil so that the ellipse fitting can run much faster than
# if the struts are left as-is.

# Factor by which to pad the pupil image before dilating and eroding.
# Needs to be large enough such that the dilation and erosion do not
# hit the edge of the array and fail.
