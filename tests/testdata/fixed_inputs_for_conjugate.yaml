# maxNollZern : int
#     The maximum Noll Zernike mode to include as part of the low-
#     order modes to split between DMs 1 and 2.
maxNollZern: 11
# nIterSmooth : int
#     Number of iterations to call the smoothing function to fill in the gaps
#     in the pupil WFE map.
nIterSmooth: 100
# nBin : int
#     Number of bins to use in AMPTHRESH when thresholding the amplitude map
#     from phase retrieval.
nBin: 21
# arrayExtFac : float
#     Factor multiplied by the beam size to create the DM surface's array
#     size. Set to larger than 1 to make sure the beam is not clipped if it
#     centered on the array.
