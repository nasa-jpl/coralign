#spotSepGuessPix : float
#    Expected (i.e., model-based) separation of the satellite spots from the
#    star. Used as the starting point for the separation for the center of
#    the region of interest. Units of pixels. Compute beforehand as
#    separation in lambda/D multiplied by pixels per lambda/D.
#    6.5*(51.46*0.575/13)
spotSepGuessPix: 14.79 

#roiRadiusPix : float
#    Radius of each region of interest used when summing the intensity of a
#    satellite spot. Units of pixels.
roiRadiusPix: 1.5

#probeRotVecDeg : array_like
#    1-D array of how many degrees counterclockwise from the x-axis to
#    rotate the regions of interest used when summing the satellite spots.
#    Note that a pair of satellite spots is given by just one value. For
#    example, for a single pair of satellite spots along the x-axis use
#    [0, ] and not [0, 180]. And for a plus-shaped layout of spots,
#    use [0, 90].
probeRotVecDeg: [0, 90]

#nSubpixels : int
#    Number of subpixels across used to make edge values of the region-of-
#    interest mask. The value of the edge pixels in the ROI is the mean of
#    all the subpixel values.
nSubpixels: 100

#nSteps : int
#    Number of points used along each direction for the grid search.
#    Odd numbers are better to provide symmetry of values when the array is
#    truly centered.
nSteps: 21

#stepSize : float
#    The step size used in the grid search. Units of pixels.
stepSize: 0.25

#nIter : int
#    Number of iterations in the loop that hones in on the radial separation
#    of the satellite spots.
nIter: 5
