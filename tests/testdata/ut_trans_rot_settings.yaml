# Parameters for performing the translation and rotation fits
# during DM registration with DMREG.

# deltazPupilToDM2 : float
#     Axial propagation distance from phase retrieval pupil to DM2.
#     Units of meters.
#deltazPupilToDM2 : 1.000

# nIterBoth : float
#     Number of times to perform the loop over translation then clocking fits.
nIterBoth : 2

# offsetMax : float
#     Max +/- distance from pupil center to search for the DM grid center.
#     Must be larger than the largest possible offset or else the quadratic
#     fitting function will perform poorly. Units of ExCAM pixels. 
offsetMax : 10.0

# nOffset : int
#     Number of translation values to evaluate between -offsetMax
#     and +offsetMax, inclusive.
nOffset : 7

# nIterOffset : int
#     Number of times to iterate the translation fit. Each new iteration is
#     centered about the previous best estimate.
nIterOffset : 3

# clockMaxDeg : float
#     Max +/- clocking value to evaluate. Must be larger than the largest
#     possible clocking value or else the quadratic fitting function will
#     perform poorly. Units of degrees.
clockMaxDeg : 3.0

# nClock : int
#     Number of clocking values to evaluate between -clockMaxDeg
#     and +clockMaxDeg, inclusive.
nClock : 7

# nIterClock : int
#     Number of times to iterate the rotation fit. Each new iteration is
#     centered about the previous best estimate.
nIterClock : 5

# shrinkFac : float
#     Factor by which to change clockMaxDeg and offsetMax after each iteration
#     of the fit. Must be >0.0 and <= 1.0.
shrinkFac : 0.8
