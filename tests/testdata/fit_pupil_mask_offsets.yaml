# FITTING PARAMETERS IN FOURIER SPACE
#
# Number of pixels (width and height) across the array to pad the pupil or mask
# array before performing an FFT. 
nPadFFT: 1024
# Number of pixels to crop down the FFT'ed pupil or pupil mask. Only the
# brightest pixels on a linear scale are used, so not many points across are
# needed. Use an odd number of points in order not to bias the quadratic fit to
# one side. This value changes if nPadFFT changes.
nFocusCrop: 21
# The pupil shear is calculated by comparing the tip/tilt phase ramps in
# Fourier space. nPhaseSteps is the number of steps across in a square grid to
# the model against the FFT'ed measured pupil or mask. Choose an odd number to
# avoid biasing the estimate in one direction.
nPhaseSteps: 41
# For the tip/tilt phase comparison in Fourier space, the step size in the grid
# is chosen based on the equivalent number of pixels moved in pupil space,
# which is dPixel.
dPixel: 0.5
# The pupil/mask shear estimation has two loops, an inner and outer one. In the
# outer loop, the simulated reference pupil/mask is regenerated from the
# high-res reference file in each iteration based on the latest shear estimate.
# This iterated approach improves accuracy. nIterOuterLoop is the number of
# outer loop iterations.
nIterOuterLoop: 5
# The pupil/mask shear estimation has two loops, an inner and outer one. In the
# inner loop, the same simulated reference pupil/mask is used but the center of
# the grid search over phases to compare is shifted to be centered on the last
# best estimate. This iterated approach improves accuracy. nIterInnerLoop is
# the number of inner loop iterations. There is usually no benefit to more than
# two of these iterations.
nIterInnerLoop: 2
# The measured pupil/mask array and the simulated reference pupil/mask may have
# different normalizations. percentileForImageNorm is the percentile (of the
# values recognized by AMPTHRESH to be in the pupil region) at which the
# normalization value is chosen for the specified array.
percentileForImageNorm: 50
