#spotSepPix : float
#    Expected separation of the satellite spots from the star. Used as the
#    separation for the center of the region of interest. Units of pixels.
#    Compute beforehand as sep in lambda/D and multiply by pix per lambda/D.
spotSepPix: 6.44 
#roiRadiusPix : float
#    Radius of each region of interest used when summing the intensity of a
#    satellite spot. Units of pixels.
roiRadiusPix: 6.0
#nSubpixels : int
#    Number of subpixels across used to make edge values of the region-of-
#    interest mask. The value of the edge pixels in the ROI is the mean of
#    all the subpixel values.
nSubpixels: 100
#maxStep : float
#    Maximum allowed estimate of the star's offset from the mask. This max
#    exists because after a certain offset one spot gets completely blocked
#    and the true offset is unknown. This max value is chosen to be equal to
#    or less than the offset value at which the spot gets completely
#    blocked. Units of pixels.
maxStep: 3.0
#fitCoefPow1 : float
#    Based on simulation, there is either a linear or quadratic change in
#    the summed ROI ratio versus stellar offset from the mask. fitCoefPow1
#    is the coefficient of the linear term in that polynomial fit. Must be a
#    positive scalar value to guarantee that the offset estimate has the
#    correct sign.
fitCoefPow1: 1.8
#fitCoefPow2 : float
#    Based on simulation, there is either a linear or quadratic change in
#    the summed ROI ratio versus stellar offset from the mask. fitCoefPow2
#    is the coefficient of the quadratic term in that polynomial fit. Must
#    be positive to avoid divide by zero and to avoid choosing the wrong
#    answer from the quadratic formula.
fitCoefPow2: 1
#powerOfFit : int, {1, 2}
#    Whether to perform a linear or quadratic fit. 1 for linear or 2 for
#    quadratic. If 1, then the value of fitCoefPow2 is ignored.
powerOfFit: 1
# maskIsInsideSpots : int {0, 1}
#    Whether the mask doing the cutting of the spots is inside or outside the 
#    spots.  An NFOV FPM has the mask on the inside (=1); an NFOV field
#    stop has the mask on the outside (=0).
maskIsInsideSpots: 1
