#spotSepPix : float
#    Expected separation of the satellite spots from the star. Used as the
#    separation for the center of the region of interest. Units of pixels.
#    Compute beforehand as sep in lambda/D and multiply by pix per lambda/D.
#    Note that this value will change from Phase B to Phase C because the
#    OWA of the bowtie will grow by 0.4 lambda/D for the final design.
spotSepPix: 25.4
#spotRotDeg : float
#    Expected rotations of the satellite spot pairs around the star will
#    be +/-spotRotNomDeg from the x-axis. Used as the clocking for the
#    centers of the regions of interest. Units of degrees.
spotRotDeg: 30.0
#spotExtraRotDeg : float
#    Extra clocking applied to make the regions of interest land on the
#    spot pairs in the image. Might be needed to account for clocking
#    among the DMs, coronagraph masks, and/or detector pixel grid. Can
#    also be set to 90 to have the ROIs be clustered about the y-axis.
#    Units of degrees. Must be a real positive scalar.
spotExtraRotDeg: 0.0
#roiRadiusPix : float
#    Radius of each region of interest used when summing the intensity of a
#    satellite spot. Units of pixels.
roiRadiusPix: 11.7
#nSubpixels : int
#    Number of subpixels across used to make edge values of the region-of-
#    interest mask. The value of the edge pixels in the ROI is the mean of
#    all the subpixel values.
nSubpixels: 100
#maxStep : float
#    Maximum allowed estimate of the star's offset from the mask. This max
#    exists because after a certain offset one spot gets completely blocked
#    and the true offset is unknown. This max value is chosen to be equal to
#    or less than the offset value at which the spot gets completely
#    blocked. Units of pixels.
maxStep: 3.0
#fitCoefPow1x : float
#    Based on simulation, there is a quadratic change in the summed
#    ROI ratio versus stellar offset from the bowie mask. fitCoefPow1
#    is the coefficient of the linear term in that polynomial fit. Must be a
#    positive scalar value to guarantee that the offset estimate has the
#    correct sign. This value is for the x-axis.
fitCoefPow1x: 0.34
#fitCoefPow2x : float
#    Based on simulation, there is a quadratic change in the summed
#    ROI ratio versus stellar offset from the bowtie mask. fitCoefPow2
#    is the coefficient of the quadratic term in that polynomial fit. Must
#    be positive to avoid divide by zero and to avoid choosing the wrong
#    answer from the quadratic formula. This value is for the x-axis.
fitCoefPow2x: 0.17
#
#fitCoefPow1y : float
#    Based on simulation, there is a quadratic change in the summed
#    ROI ratio versus stellar offset from the bowie mask. fitCoefPow1
#    is the coefficient of the linear term in that polynomial fit. Must be a
#    positive scalar value to guarantee that the offset estimate has the
#    correct sign. This value is for the y-axis.
fitCoefPow1y: 0.95
#fitCoefPow2y : float
#    Based on simulation, there is a quadratic change in the summed
#    ROI ratio versus stellar offset from the bowtie mask. fitCoefPow2
#    is the coefficient of the quadratic term in that polynomial fit. Must
#    be positive to avoid divide by zero and to avoid choosing the wrong
#    answer from the quadratic formula. This value is for the y-axis.
fitCoefPow2y: 0.3

#xRatioTarget : float
#    Desired final ratio of summed intensities along the x-axis.
#    Unitless. Default value is 1.0.
xRatioTarget : 1

#yRatioTarget : float
#    Desired final ratio of summed intensities along the y-axis.
#    Unitless. Default value is 1.0.
