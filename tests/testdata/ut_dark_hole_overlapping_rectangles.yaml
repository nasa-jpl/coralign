# Shapes to OR together to form the dark hole mask are in the
# dictionary named shapes. Any number of shapes may be combined.
# Allowed shape values are: 
#   rectangle, annulus, annular_sector, bowtie
# Each shape has its own set of required dictionary keys,
# as listed below. The name of each nested dictionary for
# an additional shape isn't actually used and simply has to
# be unique.
# Distances are in units of pixels, and angles are in degrees.
