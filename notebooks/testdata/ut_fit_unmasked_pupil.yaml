# diamHighRes is the diameter of the high-res reference unmasked pupil stored

# The amount to rotate the reference pupil before computing the clocking of
# the measured pupil
rotRef: 0

# Whether to left-right flip the reference pupil before computing the

flipxRef: False

# The factor to zero pad the reference pupil dimensions before computing

padFacRef: 1.2


# Number of iterations to run pf_util.compute_lateral_offsets()
nIterOffsets: 2

# nClock is the number of clocking values to check when determining pupil or
# mask clocking. The search is centered on zero.
nClock: 7

# When computing clocking, the nClock values checked span a range covering
# +/- clockDegMax. Units of degrees. It is better for this value to exceed the
# actual expected range of values (only a few milliradians) in order to get a
# better quadratic fit to the nClock data points.
clockDegMax: 2.5

# Number of pixels (width and height) across the array to pad the pupil or mask
# array before performing an FFT. 
nPadFFT: 1024

# Number of pixels to crop down the FFT'ed pupil or pupil mask. Only the
# brightest pixels on a linear scale are used, so not many points across are
# needed. Use an odd number of points in order not to bias the quadratic fit to
# one side. This value changes if nPadFFT changes.
nFocusCrop: 11

# For the tip/tilt phase comparison in Fourier space, the step size in the grid
# is chosen based on the equivalent number of pixels moved in pupil space,
# which is dPixel.
dPixel: 0.2

# The pupil shear is calculated by comparing the tip/tilt phase ramps in
# Fourier space. nPhaseSteps is the number of steps across in a square grid to
# the model against the FFT'ed measured pupil or mask. Choose an odd number to
# avoid biasing the estimate in one direction.
nPhaseSteps: 100

# When comparing normalized pupil or mask arrays to see if pixels "match" or
# not, a pixel is deemed to match if the values are within |deltaAmpMax| of
# each other. Choosing a larger value helps overcome noise, amplitude errors,
# and poor imaging quality. The value has to be less than 1 since the pupil or\
# mask arrays to compare are normalized.
deltaAmpMax: 0.5

# The measured pupil/mask array and the simulated reference pupil/mask may have
# different normalizations. percentileForImageNorm is the percentile (of the
# values recognized by AMPTHRESH to be in the pupil region) at which the
# normalization value is chosen for the specified array.
percentileForImageNorm: 50

# The high-res reference pupil or mask might not have any zero padding in the
# file. Some zero padding is necessary to avoid disastrous artifacts introduced
# when downsampling/rotating/translating the pupil or mask. The amount of zero
# padding to add to the array in total is zeroPaddingForHighResMask. For
# example if zeroPaddingForHighResMask = 24 and the starting array is
# 1000x1000, then the padded array is 1024x1024.
zeroPaddingForHighResMask: 24
