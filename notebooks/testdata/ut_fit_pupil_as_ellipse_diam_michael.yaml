# Number of iterations to perform for binary_dilation() and binary_erosion() 
# from scipy.ndimage.morphology. This is in the step that fills in the struts
# of the nominal pupil so that the ellipse fitting can run much faster than
# if the struts are left as-is.

# Factor by which to pad the pupil image before dilating and eroding.
# Needs to be large enough such that the dilation and erosion do not
# hit the edge of the array and fail.
padFactor: 2.0

# Keyword arguments passed directly to skimage.feature.canny() for finding
# the edges of the pupil

# Keyword arguments passed directly to skimage.transform.hough_ellipse().
