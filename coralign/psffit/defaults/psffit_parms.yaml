# Upsampling factor (essentially interpolation factor).
# Images will be registered to within
# ``1 / upsample_factor`` of a pixel. For example
# ``upsample_factor == 20`` means the images will be registered
# within 1/20th of a pixel.
upsample_factor:  200.

# padding factor for sub-image, centered on PSF
pad_factor: 1.5

# threshold for amplitude fitting (pixels greater than this value * (max of image)
# are considered for the amplitude determination)
amp_thresh: 0.2
